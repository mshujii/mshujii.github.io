					<h5>WEAR A MASK</h5>
					<p> Using face masks prevents the sick people from spewing the respiratory droplets from their noses and mouths as they capture the large infectious droplets within the mask. They can also reduce the small droplets from being dispersed into the air to a certain degree. Thus, wearing disposable face masks can significantly reduce viral transmission and help in flattening out the curve. </p>

						<h5>WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN</h5>
						<p>Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections from one person to the next. Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals. </p>

						<h5>STAY 6 FEET AWAY FROM OTHERS</h5>
						<p>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick. </p>

						<h5>MONITOR YOUR HEALTH DAILY</h5>
						<p>Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
						Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
						Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
						Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen. </p>
